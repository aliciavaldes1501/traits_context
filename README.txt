Study on the effects of plant traits and context on seed predation by Phengaris alcon on Gentiana pneumonanthe (and possibly on their consequences for plant reproduction).

Data was collected during the summer of 2015 on 3 populations of Gentiana pneumonanthe located in the county of Västra Götaland (Sweden).
Additional data was collected in a population located in Asturias (Spain) although it will most probably not be used in the study.
